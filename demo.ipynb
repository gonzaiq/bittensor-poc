    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In bittensor, there are miners & validators. A validator sends out a challenge to the miners, which they then try to solve. Validators then evaluate the miners and reward them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment, it is your job to create the core logic for a miner on a simplified version of 'Subnet 1'. That means the whole challenge will revolve around a single miner, \n",
    "for which you write the \"forward\" function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ExampleMiner(BaseModel):\n",
    "    # The forward function is the core logic of your miner. It takes in a synapse, which contains the query, and returns a synapse with the response.\n",
    "    async def forward(self, synapse: Synapse) -> Synapse:\n",
    "        print(synapse.query) # print the query\n",
    "        # your logic goes here\n",
    "        synapse.response = your_result # set the response\n",
    "        return synapse\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "You miner will be sent two types of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) One about wikipedia articles where your miner needs to respond as factually as possible. \\\n",
    "A challenge might be something like: `How fast do elephant shrews run and what weight are they?`. You must then return the optimal answer, e.g.: \\\n",
    "`Elephant shrews have been recorded to reach speeds of 28.8 kilometres per hour (17.9 mph).[8] They vary in size from about 10 to 30 centimetres (3.9 to 11.8 in), from 50 to 500 grams (1.8 to 17.6 oz). One species of giant sengi, the grey-faced sengi, weighs about 700 g.`\n",
    "The wikipedia questions are scored based on the cosine similarity between the reference answer and your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The second type are basic math questions, where you need to respond with the correct number. Your reward is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the number is correct.\\\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not expected to find an optimal solution, nor to do any clever prompt engineering (although you can if you want to). This programming test is meant to evaluate your skills at writing clean, legible python code, as well as understanding of some more advanced concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a miner, it is your interest to maximise reward, so you may apply more advanced techniques like async programming etc. to improve your miner's performance. This assignment is there for you to be able to show us your skills & creative thinking, so pretty much anything is allowed (even if it feels like cheating/an exploit).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your miner's 'forward' function acts as if it is an API endpoint which will be called every 0.2 seconds, for a total duration of 20 seconds - meaning you will receive 100 requests total. This is regardless of your response time - so even if your function runs for 2 seconds, it will be called once ever 0.2 seconds. Your miner contains a 'busy' parameter, which you can set to True if you would like to not receive a request (e.g. to avoid hitting API limits). An example workflow might look like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def forward(synapse: Synapse) -> Synapse:\n",
    "    self.busy = True # avoid getting new requests whilst your computation runs\n",
    "    # do your main computation here\n",
    "    synapse.response = your_computed_response # set the response so the validator can evaluate your response\n",
    "    self.busy = False # make yourself available again\n",
    "    return synapse # return the response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " All requests that have completed after those 20 seconds will count towards your reward. For instance, if you respond to 30 requests with an average score of 0.3 per request, your overall score would be 30 * 0.3 = 9.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Your queries will be sent from a dataset shown in dataset.csv. We advise you to have a look at the dataset first to understand what types of questions you'll be getting!\n",
    "\n",
    "## APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given access to two very basic (mock) APIs - a chat API (GPT wrapper) as well as a web search API (uses duckduckgo). You chat API has the following endpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "`openai_api.get_openai_response(prompt: str)` \n",
    "\n",
    "which will simply take an input string as a query and respond with an output string using GPT. An average call to this API endpoint takes about 0.2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, your web search api has one endpoint as well\n",
    "\n",
    "`web_search_api.search_and_scrape(query: str, n_results: int)`\n",
    "\n",
    "which will return a list of strings containing the website content of the first N results. An average call to this API endpoint takes about 2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples for how both endpoints are called can be found further down in the API section. Both APIs may raise errors occasionally & have a rate limit of 5 concurrent requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Async endpoints for both APIs are available, async_get_openai_response & async_search_and_scrape which can be called as\n",
    "\n",
    "`await openai_api.async_get_openai_response(prompt: str)` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "You may only modify the miner.py file. You may look at the dataset and take advantage of patterns/issues in it, but you may not load the dataset (e.g. to simply take the correct responses from there)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes/Quirks of the test\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may run into issues if your internet connection is bad. If you have connection errors/actual API errors (that are not our 'Random API error' and the custom 'RateLimit error') please contact your interviewer\n",
    "- This test cannot be run inside this jupyter notebook. Please modify the miner.py file and then run the main.py file to run it."

      "['What is an elephant shrew?\\nElephant shrews are not, in fact, shrews. Recent evidence suggests that they are more closely related to a group of African mammals that includes elephants, sea cows, and aardvarks. Elephant shrews (also called sengis) are represented by a single family, the Macroscelididae, including four genera and 19 living species.\\nThey take their name from their long pointed head and very long, mobile, trunk-like nose. They have rather long, legs for their size, which move in a hopping fashion like rabbits. They have a hunchbacked posture and a long, scaly tail. A gland on the underside of the tail produces a strong scent used to mark territories. This musky smell serves as a deterrent against many carnivores.\\nRhynchocyon cirnei\\n25 to 700 grams depending on the species (1 to 24 ounces)\\n22 to 30 centimeters long, not including tail (9 to 12 inches)\\n2 to 4 years\\nDense forest to open plains\\nInsectivorous\\n45 to 60 days\\nSnakes, birds of prey, various carnivores\\nChallenges\\nHabitat fragmentation is the biggest threat to elephant shrews’ survival.\\nElephant shrews distribution is limited to highly fragmented forests, which limits their access to available resources and makes finding a mate more difficult, resulting in restricted populations. Specifically, the black and rufous sengi has experienced a significant percentage of forest loss resulting in a population decline of about 20 to 30 percent in the past ten years. Drought-driven fires and increased human-induced fires have also contributed to population declines for this species.\\nSolutions\\nOur solutions to protecting the elephant shrew:\\nAfrican Wildlife Foundation engages government entities to help plan and propose alternative solutions to habitat fragmentation by providing our scientists and researchers as resources to assist in proper planning and ultimately ensuring there is a balance between modernization and conservation.\\nAWF uses science and technology to identify critical landscapes in need of intervention and then to set effective and sustainable development plans that will both improve the lives of people and protect wildlife. In the DRC, we used Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and satellite images to determine what forest areas have been disturbed due to human activity.\\nBehaviors\\nThey live in couples.\\nElephant shrews form monogamous pairs that live in common territory of several acres, but they are seldom together. They do, however, keep track of each other’s whereabouts through scent markings.\\nThey are not friendly toward strangers.\\nThey are intolerant of close neighbors, and should one trespass into the territory it will be violently evicted. Aggressive encounters involve screaming, sparring, snapping, and kicking, all of which can happen so rapidly that it appears to be a blur of animals tumbling on the forest floor.\\nThe young are most vulnerable when leaving their parents.\\nElephant shrews give birth four or five times a year. The fully haired newborn remains hidden for the first three weeks and then follows the mother for about a week. After weaning and becoming independent, the offspring remain in the parent’s territory for another six weeks. By that time, it is almost adult size and leaves to establish its territory.\\nDiet\\nElephant shrews like bugs.\\nThe elephant shrew eats “leaf litter invertebrates” such as ants, termites, beetles, spiders, millipedes, and earthworms. Unlike many other small mammals, the elephant shrew feeds during daylight. They play a significant role in maintaining natural checks of insect populations.\\nHabitats\\nWhere do elephant shrews live?\\nThe species as a whole is widely distributed throughout Africa, excluding western Africa and the Sahara region, but despite their wide distribution range, sightings are still rare. The four-toed elephant shrew is one of the most widespread of the species, occurring from Central and Eastern Africa to the Northeastern corner of South Africa. The four species of giant elephant shrew prefer to live in forests, closed-canopy woodlands, and thickets, usually with a floor densely covered by leaf litter. The checkered elephant shrew is found in Central Africa; the golden-rumped elephant shrew is endemic to Kenya; the grey-faced shrew is confined to two forests in Tanzania, and the black and rufous elephant shrew is found in East Africa. Smaller elephant shrew species can be found in the uplands of southern, eastern, and northwestern Africa, in dry forests, scrub, savannas, and open country covered by sparse shrubs of grass.', 'elephant shrew\\nOur editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article.\\nelephant shrew, (order Macroscelidea), any of approximately 20 species of rat-sized African mammals named for their long, tapered, and flexible snout (proboscis). All have slim bodies, slender limbs, and very long hind legs and feet. Although they resemble shrews, they are not insectivores but constitute the mammalian order Macroscelidea.\\nElephant shrews are terrestrial and are active during the day. Their ears and eyes are large, and, when alarmed, they run on their toes swiftly along paths they construct and maintain, sometimes leaping over obstacles. When foraging, they move along the pathways, using their paws and the constantly moving proboscis to turn over leaf litter and soil in search of prey, which consists of small insects (especially ants and termites), other arthropods, and earthworms. Gestation lasts two months, and litters contain one or two well-developed young.\\nCheckered elephant shrews (Rhynchocyon cirnei) weigh about half a kilogram (1.1 pounds), with a body 23 to 31 cm (9 to 12 inches) long and a slightly shorter tail (18 to 25 cm). The fur is short, stiff, and glossy. Upperparts may be patterned with chestnut and buff; they may be orange on the forequarters, changing to dark red and then black on the rump, or uniformly dark amber with a shiny golden rump. The bicoloured tail is finely haired and appears bare. These elegant long-legged animals are similar in body form to small forest antelopes (see dik-dik; duiker). They live only in East Africa, where they inhabit tropical forests (including deciduous lowland and montane forests) with well-drained soils and carpets of leaf litter. Nests are made of dry leaves on the open forest floor.\\nThe largest species, the giant elephant shrew (R. udzungwensis), weighs about 0.7 kg (1.5 pounds) and inhabits two forested areas within the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania.\\nThe smaller species weigh 30 to 280 grams, with bodies 9 to 22 cm long and shorter tails of 8 to 18 cm. The soft, dense fur ranges from grayish brown to dark brown, in tones usually matching the soil where they live. They are found in the uplands of southern, eastern, and extreme northwestern Africa, inhabiting dry forests and scrub, savannas, open country covered by sparse shrubs or grass, semiarid and rocky habitats, and sandy, sparsely vegetated plains. They rest and den in burrows, rock crevices, depressions in the ground, and termite mounds, beneath fallen tree trunks, among tree roots, or in dense underbrush.\\nIn addition to the checkered elephant shrews, the family Macroscelididae also includes the long-eared elephant shrews (genus Elephantulus), the round-eared sengis (Macroscelides proboscideus, M. flavicaudatus, and M. micus), and the four-toed elephant shrew (Petrodromus tetradactylus); those three genera are classified together in a subfamily separate from Rhynchocyon. Macroscelididae is the only family in the order Macroscelidea. There are eight extinct genera, some of which had teeth similar to antelopes’ and were probably herbivores. The evolutionary history of elephant shrews is confined to Africa and dates to the Late Eocene (41.3 to 33.9 million years ago). Their closest relatives were thought to be tree shrews and insectivores, but since the 1950s elephant shrews have been recognized as a distinct order. They are possibly related to rabbits and rodents, although molecular data suggest that they may be more closely related to an ancient group that gave rise to the aardvarks, elephants, hyraxes, and sirenians.', 'Elephant shrew\\nElephant shrew[3] Temporal range:\\n| |\\n---|---|\\nBlack and rufous elephant shrew, Rhynchocyon petersi, Philadelphia Zoo | |\\nScientific classification | |\\nDomain: | Eukaryota |\\nKingdom: | Animalia |\\nPhylum: | Chordata |\\nClass: | Mammalia |\\nInfraclass: | Placentalia |\\nSuperorder: | Afrotheria |\\nGrandorder: | Afroinsectiphilia |\\nMirorder: | Afroinsectivora |\\nOrder: | Macroscelidea Butler, 1956 |\\nFamily: | Macroscelididae Bonaparte, 1838 |\\nType genus | |\\nMacroscelides A. Smith, 1829\\n| |\\nGenera | |\\nElephantulus | |\\nRange map of elephant shrew by genus |\\nElephant shrews, also called jumping shrews or sengis, are small insectivorous mammals native to Africa, belonging to the family Macroscelididae, in the order Macroscelidea. Their traditional common English name \"elephant shrew\" comes from a perceived resemblance between their long noses and the trunk of an elephant, and their superficial similarity with shrews (family Soricidae) in the order Eulipotyphla. However, phylogenetic analysis has revealed that elephant shrews are not properly classified with true shrews, but are in fact more closely related to elephants than to shrews.[4] In 1997, the biologist Jonathan Kingdon proposed that they instead be called \"sengis\" (singular sengi),[5] a term derived from the Bantu languages of Africa, and in 1998, they were classified into the new clade Afrotheria.[6]\\nThey are widely distributed across the southern part of Africa, and although common nowhere, can be found in almost any type of habitat, from the Namib Desert to boulder-strewn outcrops in South Africa to thick forest. One species, the North African elephant shrew, remains in the semi-arid, mountainous country in the far northwest of Africa. The Somali elephant shrew went unobserved from 1968 to 2020 but was rediscovered by a group of scientists in Djibouti.[7]\\nDescription\\n[edit]Elephant shrews are small, quadrupedal, insectivorous mammals. They have scaly tails, long snouts, and bear a superficial resemblance to shrews or rodents. They have long legs relative to their size, which are used to move from one place to another like rabbits. Elephant shrews use their flexible proboscises to search for food, with the length of the snout varying between species.\\nThey are one of the fastest small mammals, having been recorded to reach speeds of 28.8 kilometres per hour (17.9 mph).[8] They vary in size from about 10 to 30 centimetres (3.9 to 11.8 in), from 50 to 500 grams (1.8 to 17.6 oz).[citation needed] One species of giant sengi, the grey-faced sengi, weighs about 700 g. Compared to other mammalian insectivores, sengis have relatively large brains.[9] Their lifespans are about two and a half to four years in the wild.[10][page needed] They have large canine teeth, and also high-crowned cheek teeth similar to those of ungulates.[11] Their dental formula is 1-3.1.4.23.1.4.2-3G[citation needed]\\nBehavior and ecology\\n[edit]Although mostly diurnal[12] and very active, they are difficult to trap and very seldom seen; elephant shrews are wary, well camouflaged, and adept at dashing away from threats. Several species make a series of cleared pathways through the undergrowth and spend their day patrolling them for insect life. If the animal is disturbed, the pathway provides an obstacle-free escape route.\\nElephant shrews are solitary animals, despite many species living in monogamous pairs. They share and defend their home territory, which is marked using their scent glands.[11] Scent markings are also used for mate attraction.[13]\\nShort-eared elephant shrews inhabit the dry steppes and stone deserts of southwestern Africa. They can even be found in the Namib Desert, one of the driest regions of the earth. Females drive away other females, while males try to ward off other males. Although they live in pairs, the partners do not care much for each other and their sole purpose of even associating with the opposite sex is for reproduction. Social behaviors are not very common and they even have separate nests. The one or two young are well developed at birth; they are able to run within a few hours.[14]\\nFemale elephant shrews undergo a menstrual cycle similar to that of human females, making it one of the few nonprimate mammals to do so.[15] Elephant shrews were used in the 1940s to study the human menstruation cycle.[16] The elephant shrew mating period lasts for several days. After mating, the pair will return to their solitary habits. After a gestation period varying from 45 to 60 days, the female will bear litters of one to three young several times a year. The young are born relatively well developed, but remain in the nest for several days before venturing outside.[11]\\nAfter five days, the young\\'s milk diet is supplemented with mashed insects, which are collected and transported in the cheek pouches of the female. The young then slowly start to explore their environment and hunt for insects. After about 15 days, the young will begin the migratory phase of their lives, which lessens their dependency on their mother. The young will then establish their own home ranges (about 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi)) and will become sexually active within 41–46 days.[17][18]\\nThe thermal characteristics of elephant shrews with similar body size, habitat and distribution are very close in most of the classifications. They can maintain homeothermy in different ambient temperatures where most of the species regulate their body temperature at 35 °C and neither become hyperthermic but they balance the heat offload by increasing the EWL (evaporative water loss).[19]\\nFeeding habits\\n[edit]Elephant shrews mainly eat insects, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and earthworms. While awake, as much as 80% of their time may be spent foraging.[20] An elephant shrew uses its nose to find prey and uses its tongue to flick small food into its mouth, much like an anteater. Eating large prey can pose a challenge; an elephant shrew struggling with an earthworm must first pin its prey to the ground with a forefoot. Then, turning its head to one side, it chews pieces off with its cheek teeth, much like a dog chewing a bone. This is a sloppy process, and many small pieces of worm drop to the ground; these are simply flicked up with the tongue. Some elephant shrews also feed on small amounts of plant matter, especially new leaves, seeds, and small fruits.[17]\\nEvolution\\n[edit]A number of fossil species are known, all from Africa. They were separate from the similar-appearing order Leptictida. A considerable diversification of macroscelids occurred in the Paleogene period. Some, such as Myohyrax, were so similar to hyraxes that they were initially included with that group, while others, such as Mylomygale, were relatively rodent-like. These unusual forms all died out by the Pleistocene.[21] Although macroscelids were classified in the past with many groups, often on the basis of superficial characteristics, considerable morphological and molecular evidence places them within Afrotheria, at the base of Afroinsectivora.[22]\\nIn terms of timing, the divergence between macroscelids and afrosoricidans is thought to have occurred roughly 57.5 million years (Ma) ago, in the late Paleocene, while the diversification of extant macroscelids apparently began when the Rhynchocyon lineage split off about 33 Ma ago, in the early Oligocene.[23] Elephantulus is considered to have separated from Macroscelidini later in the Oligocene, about 28.5 Ma ago.[23]\\nPhylogeny\\n[edit]A cladogram of Afrotheria based on molecular evidence[22] |\\nCladogram of living elephant shrews[24][23] | |||||||||\\n|\\nClassification\\n[edit]The 20 species of elephant shrew are placed in six genera, three of which are monotypic:\\n- ORDER MACROSCELIDEA[3]\\n- Family Macroscelididae\\n- Genus Elephantulus\\n- Short-snouted elephant shrew, E. brachyrhynchus\\n- Cape elephant shrew, E. edwardii\\n- Dusky-footed elephant shrew, E. fuscipes\\n- Dusky elephant shrew, E. fuscus\\n- Bushveld elephant shrew, E. intufi\\n- Eastern rock elephant shrew, E. myurus\\n- Karoo rock elephant shrew, E. pilicaudus[25]\\n- Western rock elephant shrew, E. rupestris\\n- Genus Galegeeska\\n- Somali elephant shrew, G. revoilii[23]\\n- Rufous elephant shrew, G. rufescens[26]\\n- Genus Macroscelides\\n- Namib round-eared sengi, M. flavicaudatus\\n- Etendeka round-eared sengi, M. micus\\n- Round-eared elephant shrew, M. proboscideus\\n- Genus Petrodromus\\n- Four-toed elephant shrew, P. tetradactylus\\n- Genus Petrosaltator\\n- North African elephant shrew, P. rozeti\\n- Genus Rhynchocyon\\n- Golden-rumped sengi, R. chrysopygus\\n- Rhynchocyon chrysopygus mandelai[27]\\n- Chequered sengi, R. cirnei\\n- Rhynchocyon cirnei cirnei\\n- Rhynchocyon cirnei shirensis\\n- Rhynchocyon cirnei reichardi\\n- Rhynchocyon cirnei hendersoni\\n- Rhynchocyon cirnei macrurus\\n- Black and rufous sengi, R. petersi\\n- Rhynchocyon petersi petersi\\n- Rhynchocyon petersi adersi\\n- Stuhlmann\\'s sengi, R. stuhlmanni[28]\\n- Grey-faced sengi, R. udzungwensis\\n- Golden-rumped sengi, R. chrysopygus\\n- Genus Elephantulus\\n- Family Macroscelididae\\nReferences\\n[edit]- ^ Martin Pickford; Brigitte Senut; Helke Mocke; Cécile Mourer-Chauviré; Jean-Claude Rage; Pierre Mein (2014). \"Eocene aridity in southwestern Africa: timing of onset and biological consequences\".
